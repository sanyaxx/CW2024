   When a player loses the game, the **Redeem Life Overlay** is displayed for a brief 5-second window.

2. **Options for Redemption**:
   - Players with at least **2 coins** can revive their game and restore one of the key gameplay parameters:
      - **Health**: If the player's health reached zero, it is restored.
      - **Bullet Count**: If the player ran out of ammunition, bullets are replenished.
      - **Fuel Capacity**: If fuel depletion caused the loss, fuel is refilled.
   - The coins required for revival (2 coins) are deducted from the player's total.

3. **Automatic Transition**:  
   If no action is taken within the 5-second timer, the player is considered to have forfeited the redemption, and the game transitions to the **Level Lost Overlay**.

#### **Insufficient Balance Notification**
**Scenario**:  
If the player attempts to redeem life but lacks sufficient coins:
1. The **Insufficient Balance Overlay** is displayed, notifying the player of their inability to continue due to inadequate resources.
2. This overlay offers a single actionable button to redirect user to LevelLostOverlay, maintaining clarity.

#### **Implementation Details**
1. **Redemption Logic**:
   - When the **Redeem Life Overlay** is shown, the system checks the playerâ€™s coin balance.
   - If coins >= 2:
      - Coins are decremented using the `decrementCoins()` method in the `UserStatsManager`.
      - The parameter responsible for the loss is restored:
         - `reviveUserLife()` restores health.
         - Additional bullets are added if the bullet count is zero.
         - Fuel is refilled using `reviveUserFuel()` if needed.
      - The game resumes with the timeline (`playTimeline()`).

   - If coins < 2:
      - The **Insufficient Balance Overlay** is triggered via `insufficientInventory()`.

2. **Post-Redemption Gameplay**:
   - Players who successfully redeem life continue from the same state but with restored resources, ensuring minimal disruption to immersion.
   - This mechanic discourages frivolous retries, as coins are a finite resource.

#### **Benefits of This Feature**
1. **Enhanced Engagement**:  
   The redemption system keeps players invested in their progress, reducing frustration and encouraging persistence.
2. **Resource Management**:  
   Players must balance spending coins for revival versus saving them for future upgrades or challenges.
3. **Second Chances**:  
   Offers a fair second-chance mechanic without compromising the game's challenge or stakes.
4. **Player Retention**:  
   By offering an in-game solution to failure, players are less likely to abandon the game after a loss.

## Implemented but not working properly
#### Noted: There are currently no features in the game that aren't working properly. However, I encountered several issues during development. Below are a few notable problems and how I overcame them:

1) **Enemy Spawning Logic:**
    - **Issue:** The game had a maximum number of enemies that could spawn. Initially, I incremented `currentNumberOfEnemies` whenever an enemy spawned and decremented it when an enemy was killed or penetrated defenses. However, I realized that the `currentNumberOfEnemies` was going negative, causing the system to spawn more enemies than intended. This resulted in situations where negative values (e.g., -99) would allow a much higher number of enemies (e.g., 99) to spawn, bypassing the cap.
    - **Solution:** I added a check in the collision handler to ensure that `currentNumberOfEnemies` would only decrement if its value was greater than 0. This prevented negative values and ensured the spawning logic remained within the set maximum.

2) **Coin Attraction with Magnet:**
    - **Issue:** The magnet was supposed to attract coins towards the player, but the coins were moving to incorrect locations. I had mistakenly used `user.getTranslateX()` to obtain the player's position, which gave me the relative position of the user plane instead of the actual grid coordinates.
    - **Solution:** I updated the logic to use `getLayoutX()` combined with `getTranslateX()`, which provided the correct actual position on the grid. This fixed the coin attraction, and coins now properly follow the user.

3) **Lag in Level 3:**
    - **Issue:** Level 3 was experiencing significant lag and became unresponsive after some time. I discovered that many actors were being created but not destroyed, causing memory bloat and slowing the game.
    - **Solution:** I ensured that any enemy planes that left the screen boundaries were destroyed and removed from the active actors array. This eliminated the memory overload, improved performance, and removed the lag in Level 3.
---

## Features Not yet implemented 

1. **User Login and Progress System:**
    - **Implementation Plan:** I intended to develop a login and user progress tracking system, allowing players to save and load their progress (e.g., current level, score). Files were created, including `UserProgress` and `ProgressManager` classes, designed to serialize and store player data locally. The logic to track and update the user's progress was also mapped out, with mechanisms to save and load progress from files. Additionally, a registration system was drafted with functionality for new users to register, and existing users to log in and resume their game at the saved level.
    - **Reason for Incompletion:** Due to time constraints, the integration of these components with the game's main logic and UI was left unfinished, and further testing and finalization were required. The plan was to provide a seamless experience where users could pick up where they left off, but this feature remains a planned enhancement.

2. **Game Level Menu:**
    - **Implementation Plan:** I wanted to create a game menu that would allow users to select a specific level to play, showing a visual representation of completed levels and unlocked levels. Once a player finishes a level, they should be able to go back to the menu and choose any previously unlocked level. This would allow for non-linear progression where players could revisit any level they completed, adding replayability and a sense of achievement as they progress through the game.
    - **Reason for Incompletion:** The logic for the level progression and menu was outlined but not fully implemented. The menu interface was not created due to lack of time, and further work was required to integrate level unlocking, saving, and displaying progress dynamically.

3. **Multiplayer Mode:**
    - **Implementation Plan:** I wanted to incorporate a competitive multiplayer mode where one player controls the protagonist (the user) and the other controls the enemy. In this mode, the two players would compete in real-time, with the user completing objectives or attempting to defeat the other player. The enemy player would try to stop the user by setting traps, controlling enemies, or directly attacking. This would create an engaging PvP experience, providing a dynamic and competitive layer to the game.
    - **Reason for Incompletion:** Due to time constraints, the multiplayer mechanics, such as networking and synchronization of the players' actions, were not implemented. While the core concept was outlined, the development of features like matchmaking, real-time interaction, and balancing between the user and enemy roles was left unfinished and would require further work to be fully functional.

## New Java Classes

### 1. `AppStage`

- **Purpose**: The `AppStage` class is a singleton that manages the application's primary stage. It provides a centralized way to access and manipulate the main stage across different parts of the application.

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.controller.AppStage`

- **Key Implementation**:
    - **Singleton Design Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of `AppStage` exists during the application's lifecycle.
    - **Primary Stage Management**: Stores and provides access to the primary `Stage` instance using `setPrimaryStage()` and `getPrimaryStage()` methods.

- **Usage**:
    - **Main Class**: In the `Main` class (`com.example.demo.controller.Main`), `AppStage.getInstance().setPrimaryStage(stage)` is used to set the primary stage, making it accessible globally in the application.
    - Instance used in several other classes to get `stage` dimensions for class-specific usage.
**Benefits**:
- **Centralized Stage Management**: Ensures consistency and flexibility when accessing the main `Stage` throughout different screens and components of the app.
- **Improved Code Maintainability**: The singleton pattern allows for better control of the stage without needing to pass it through multiple methods or classes.
 
---

### 2. `GameLoop`

- **Purpose**: The `GameLoop` class is a singleton responsible for managing the game's update cycle, controlling the timeline, and updating entities that implement the `Updatable` interface. It provides centralized control over game updates, including the ability to pause and resume.

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.controller.GameLoop`

- **Key Implementation**:
    - **Singleton Design**: Ensures only one instance of the `GameLoop` exists, providing consistent access to the game loop across the application.
    - **Timeline Management**: Uses a `Timeline` to control the game's update cycle, invoking updates for all registered `Updatable` objects at regular intervals.
    - **Updatable Interface**: Entities that need to be updated (like planes, coins, etc.) implement the `Updatable` interface, which the game loop calls every cycle.

- **Usage**:
    - **Entity Updates**: Entities like `UserPlane`, `EnemyPlane`, and `Coins` implement `Updatable`, and their `update()` method is called each frame by the `GameLoop`.
    - **Pause/Resume**: The game loop can be paused or resumed externally via the singleton, allowing external components to control game flow.

**Benefits**:
- **Centralized Update Management**: The singleton `GameLoop` ensures consistent and coordinated updates across the game.
- **Modular and Flexible**: The `Updatable` interface allows entities to manage their own logic independently while being synchronized by the game loop.
- **External Control**: The ability to pause and resume the game externally enhances flexibility without modifying game logic.

---

### 3. **Interface:** `Updatable`

- **Purpose**: The `Updatable` interface is designed to ensure that any class implementing it provides an `update()` method, which is called every frame to update the object's state. This is essential for objects like game entities, which need periodic updates (e.g., movement, position changes, or interactions with other objects).

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.actors.Updatable`

- **Usage**:
    - **Updatable Interface**: The interface declares a single method, `update()`, which must be implemented by any class that needs to be updated regularly.
    - **Entity Updates**: Any class that represents a game entity, such as `UserPlane` or `EnemyPlane`, implements `Updatable` to ensure that its state is refreshed every frame. For example, the position of these entities may change based on user input or game logic.
    - **Centralized Actor Management**: The `ActorManager` uses its `update()` method to call `update()` on all active game entities. This centralizes the update logic, making it easier to manage and ensure consistent behavior across the game world. It iterates over the `activeActors` list and calls `update()` on each actor during every game frame. This ensures that all actors are synchronized and their states are updated accordingly.
    - **Level Management**: The `LevelParent` class uses the `update()` method to coordinate more complex updates, like collision detection, game-over checks, and spawning of new entities. The `Updatable` interface allows it to call `update()` on entities that need to be updated, thus decoupling the game logic and promoting scalability.

**Benefits**:
- **Consistency and Synchronization**: By implementing the `Updatable` interface, each entity in the game guarantees that its state is updated consistently on every frame. This leads to smooth and predictable game behavior.
- **Modular and Scalable**: The interface allows game entities to define their own update logic while leaving the responsibility for managing and updating them to higher-level components like `ActorManager` and `LevelParent`. This modular design makes it easy to scale the game as new entities or behaviors are introduced.
- **Efficient Game State Management**: The `ActorManager` centralizes the update process, ensuring that all active actors are updated efficiently, and their changes are reflected in the game world without requiring individual management in each class.

---

### 3. **Interface: `Collidable`**

- **Purpose**: The `Collidable` interface defines methods for handling collisions between game entities. It ensures that each object capable of collision can manage damage and identify its relationship to other objects (i.e., whether it is friendly or an enemy).

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.actors.Collidable`

- **Key Implementation**:
    - **takeDamage Method**: This method allows objects to respond to damage when colliding with others. It is implemented by game entities to define what happens to them (e.g., losing health, being destroyed) upon a collision.
    - **isFriendly Method**: This method checks whether an object is a friendly entity or an enemy. This distinction is crucial for ensuring that friendly entities donâ€™t cause damage to each other, while enemy entities interact differently, such as being damaged or destroyed upon collision.
    - **GameEntity Class**: Implements `Collidable` along with other interfaces. Each `GameEntity` provides custom logic for the `takeDamage()` and `isFriendly()` methods. For example, a `UserPlane` may be destroyed upon collision with an enemy, while an enemy plane may be destroyed when hit by a friendly projectile.

**Benefits**:
  - **Collision Flexibility**: The `Collidable` interface allows different game entities to define their specific reactions to collisions, making it easier to manage diverse behaviors across various actor types.
  - **Streamlined Damage Handling**: By defining standardized methods for damage and entity classification, the interface simplifies the collision detection process. The game engine can check if objects are `Collidable`, and then delegate the appropriate response (e.g., applying damage, destruction).
  - **Scalability**: New types of collidable objects can be easily added by implementing the `Collidable` interface, ensuring that all future entities automatically handle damage and classification without modifying the existing system.

---

### 4. **Interface:** `Collectible`

- **Purpose**: The `Collectible` interface defines a method to check whether a game entity can be collected by the player, typically items like coins, fuel, or power-ups. It helps identify objects that are collectable and ensures that the game logic treats them differently, particularly during collision handling.

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.actors.Collectible`

- **Key Implementation**:
    - **isCollectible Method**: This method checks if an object is collectable. If an actor (e.g., coin, fuel) is collectable, it means the player can collect it without penalty (such as losing health). Non-collectable objects, such as enemy units, should not be collected and should trigger damage or destruction upon collision.
    - **GameEntity Class**: Implements the `Collectible` interface along with other interfaces. Each specific type of `GameEntity` provides its own implementation of the `isCollectible()` method to return true for items that can be collected by the player (e.g., `Coins`, `Fuel`) and false for non-collectable entities like enemies.

**Benefits**:
- **Clear Object Classification**: The `Collectible` interface helps distinguish between collectable and non-collectable objects, ensuring that friendly items like coins or fuel are treated correctly during collisions.
- **Collision Handling Simplification**: In the collision detection system, the `isCollectible()` method allows the game to determine whether to trigger damage or not. Collectable objects donâ€™t cause damage when colliding with enemy units, but non-collectables (such as enemies) do.
- **Extensibility**: New collectable objects can easily be added to the game by implementing the `Collectible` interface, allowing items with different functionalities (e.g., bonus points, health boosts) to be introduced without altering the existing collision system.

- **Location**: `com.example.demo.actors.Planes.enemyPlanes`

#### **Key Features**
1. **Inherited from `FighterPlane`**:
2. **Directional Movement**:
    - The rocket moves in one of four possible directions (North, East, South, or West). The direction is determined by the `direction` variable, which is passed during instantiation.
    - The movement is implemented using the `rotatePlane` and `moveHorizontally` or `moveVertically` methods, which ensure that the rocket's position is updated based on its launch direction.
3. **Health and Damage**:
    - The rocket starts with an initial health value of 1 and can take damage. If it collides with an object or another actor in the game, the `takeDamage()` method is called, reducing its health.
    - If the health drops to 0, the rocket is considered destroyed and removed from the game.
4. **No Projectile Firing**:
    - Unlike other actors, the `EnemyRocket` does not fire projectiles itself (the `fireProjectile()` method returns `null`). This simplifies its role to being a direct threat that the player needs to avoid or destroy.
5. **Not Friendly or Collectible**:
    - The `isFriendly()` method returns `false`, indicating that the rocket is an enemy.
    - The `isCollectible()` method also returns `false`, so it is not an item that the player can collect, unlike coins or other bonuses.

#### **Why It Was Implemented**
The `EnemyRocket` class was introduced to increase the complexity and variety of enemy behavior in the game.

## Modified Java Classes

#### Class: `Controller`
In the modified `Controller` class:

1. **Removal of Level Collision Handling**: The original class had logic for handling level transitions and collision detection within the `goToLevel()` method, which has now been streamlined for level management. Collision handling has been moved to a separate manager class, removing this responsibility from the `Controller`.
2. **Launch Screen Addition**: The `launchGame()` method has been changed to instantiate and show a `StartScreen` instead of immediately loading a level. This refactor now allows for a start screen before the game begins.
3. **Error Handling Consolidation**: A new private method, `showError()`, has been added to handle exceptions more cleanly, centralizing the error display logic that was previously embedded within the `update()` method.
4. **Refactored Imports**: The `LevelParent` class is now imported from the `levels` package instead of directly from the root package, aligning with a better organizational structure.
5. **Observer Handling**: The observer functionality is preserved, with the `Controller` still updating levels upon receiving notifications. However, the collision and level management logic is cleaner and more modular, with the `Controller` now focusing more on the flow of the game rather than game mechanics.

These changes simplify the class, making it more maintainable and focused on managing the game flow rather than internal game logic like collisions.

#### Class: `Main`
In the modified `Main` class:
1. **Dynamic Screen Size**: The screen size is set dynamically based on the primary screenâ€™s dimensions, replacing the fixed values for width and height.
2. **Maximized Window**: The window is now maximized by default for better screen usage.
3. **LevelManager Integration**: The `LevelManager` is introduced to centralize game level handling, with the `Controller` registered as an observer for level transitions.
4. **AppStage Access**: The primary stage is stored in `AppStage`, allowing easy access from other classes.
These changes improve flexibility, modularity, and organization by dynamically adjusting the screen size and managing game levels more effectively.

#### Class: `ActiveActor`

The `ActiveActor` class, now in the `com.example.demo.actors` package, remains largely unchanged in terms of functionality. It extends `ImageView`, providing a base for actors in the game to manage their images and movements. The constructor sets up the actor's image, position, and size. The class includes abstract `updatePosition()` and concrete methods for moving horizontally and vertically. The main change is the relocation of the class to a different package for better organization, without altering its functionality.

#### Class: `ActiveActorDestructible` â†’ `GameEntity`

The class `ActiveActorDestructible` (from the `com.example.demo` package) was renamed and refactored into `GameEntity` (moved to `com.example.demo.actors`). While the original `ActiveActorDestructible` only handled destructibility and basic movement, the new `GameEntity` class expands its functionality by implementing the `Collidable`, `Collectible`, and `Updatable` interfaces, offering a more comprehensive structure for game entities. The new class includes methods for managing collisions, updates, collectibility, and determining whether an entity is friendly, alongside retaining destructibility and movement features from the old class.

#### Interface: `Destructible` â†’ `Collidable`

The `Destructible` interface, located in the `com.example.demo` package, was refactored and renamed to `Collidable` (in the `com.example.demo.actors` package). The `Collidable` interface retains the `takeDamage()` method from `Destructible` but adds a new method `isFriendly()` to determine if the entity is friendly or not. The old `destroy()` method from `Destructible` was removed as it was incorporated into other game entity handling logic, specifically in the `GameEntity` class.

#### Class: `LevelParent` Changes

**Old Class:**
- Managed the game flow, actors, and level transitions.
- Handled core gameplay mechanics like projectile firing, collision detection, and enemy spawning.

**New Class:**
- Refactored to use the **actor-manager pattern**, with `ActorManager` centralizing actor handling. Removed 4 different arrays of different types of actors on the screen and made it into one activeActors array in the actorManager class. Now all active actors were added/removed form this one class which made handling easier.
- **Input handling** and **collision handling** were moved to dedicated classes (`InputHandler` and `CollisionHandler`).
- **Magnet effect** introduced, which attracts `Coins` within a specified radius, managed by `activateMagnet()` and `deactivateMagnet()`.
- Enhanced **UI updates** through the `LevelView` class, including dynamic changes to hearts and score displays.
- Refined game state management with the `LevelStateHandler` and `OverlayHandler`, providing more granular control over level pauses, wins, and losses.
- Changed the name of the method in updateLevelView() to update the heart display from removeHearts() to syncHeartsWithUserHealth().

**Key Changes:**
- **Actor Management:** Actors like coins, enemies, and projectiles are now handled by `ActorManager`.
- **Collision & Spawn Management:** Dedicated handlers for collisions (`CollisionHandler`) and spawning (`SpawnHandler`).
- **Magnet Effect:** A magnet system allows for coin attraction to the player when activated.
- **UI & Level Handling:** Extensive use of `LevelView` to manage UI elements such as the score, health, and other gameplay overlays.

#### Class: `FighterPlane` Changes

**Old Class:**
- The `FighterPlane` class was derived from `ActiveActorDestructible`.
- It had a `health` property and abstracted the `fireProjectile()` method for subclasses.
- The `takeDamage()` method decreased health and destroyed the plane if health reached zero.

**New Class:**
- The class is now derived from `GameEntity` instead of `ActiveActorDestructible`.
- **ActorManager Integration:** When health reaches zero, the `ActorManager` removes the destroyed `FighterPlane` instance.
- **Rotation:** Added a `rotatePlane(int angle)` method to handle rotation of the plane.
- **Health Management:** Added `incrementHealth()` and `decrementHealth()` methods to adjust health dynamically, alongside the existing `takeDamage()` method.
- **Destruction Flag:** Uses an `isDestroyed` flag to track destruction, in place of directly calling `destroy()`.

**Key Changes:**
- **Inheritance Change:** The class now inherits from `GameEntity`, centralizing entity behavior management.
- **Actor Removal:** The `ActorManager` now handles removal of destroyed planes.
- **Health Modifications:** The new `incrementHealth()` and `decrementHealth()` methods provide finer control over health changes.

#### Class: `UserProjectile`

**Old Class:**
- Inherited from `Projectile`.
- Used a constant horizontal velocity for movement.
- `updatePosition()` moved the projectile horizontally.

**Modifications:**
- **Movement Logic:** Now incorporates both horizontal and vertical velocities (`HORIZONTAL_VELOCITY` and `VERTICAL_VELOCITY`), depending on the direction of the shot.
- **Direction Handling:** The `direction` (rotation angle) is passed to the constructor to determine the projectile's movement (e.g., North, East, South, West).
- **Rotation:** Uses `rotateProjectile()` to apply the direction of movement to the projectile.
- **Damage Handling:** Inherited `takeDamage()` from `Projectile`, which removes the projectile upon taking damage.
